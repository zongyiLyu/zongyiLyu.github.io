### *Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection*
**2023.01 - 2023.06**

**Supervisor: Prof. [Yongyong Chen(陈勇勇)](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/chenyongyong)**


- Introduced a novel method for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection using Multimodal Low-Rank Tensor Representation (MLTR), and improved the accuracy and generalization capabilities of HAD by employing a low-rank representation of multi-modal tensors.
- Outperformed previous methods on ten datasets and achieved a higher AUC, including the SanDiego dataset. Reduced the running time by approximately 20% compared to TLRSR.
- The paper is submitted to IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters.
