{Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection}  {Jan.2023 - June.2023} //
{Supervisor: Prof. Yongyong Chen}  {Shenzhen, China}
- Introduced a novel method for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection using Multimodal Low-Rank Tensor Representation (MLTR), and improved the accuracy and generalization capabilities of HAD by employing a low-rank representation of multi-modal tensors.
- Outperformed previous methods on ten datasets and achieved a higher AUC, including the San Diego dataset. Reduced the running time by approximately 20% compared to TLRSR.
- The paper is submitted to IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters.
